"""
Full rich prompt engine (Build Order Step 11).

Replaces main.py's plain `input(_render_prompt(cfg))` call with a
`prompt_toolkit.PromptSession`-driven read, so the REPL prompt line itself
is colored (via ui/prompt.py's render_prompt_ansi) rather than the plain
"<folder> (<model>) <icon> " string Step 6 originally produced.

Why prompt_toolkit and not a plain `input()` + ANSI-string prompt (the
simpler alternative): `input()` accepts only a `str` prompt argument, and a
raw ANSI-escaped string passed there types-and-displays correctly on most
terminals but breaks line-editing (backspace/arrow-key redraw) on some,
because the terminal's own readline layer doesn't know the escape
sequences aren't part of the editable text. `prompt_toolkit.PromptSession`
is explicitly designed to accept a styled prompt (as its own `ANSI`/
`HTML`/`FormattedText` types) and keep line-editing correct regardless --
this is the actual reason Step 11 reaches for a real prompt library instead
of hand-rolling ANSI codes into `input()`.

Testability (Section 16 Rule 5 -- this module's own design, since
prompt_toolkit has no drop-in equivalent to a fake `input()` callable):
`ReplSession` wraps a `PromptSession` behind a small interface
(`prompt(text) -> str`) so tests can substitute a fake with the same shape
without importing prompt_toolkit at all. `PromptSession` is only
constructed lazily, inside `ReplSession.__init__`, specifically so
importing this module in a test file never requires a real terminal
(prompt_toolkit's default input/output backends probe the terminal at
PromptSession-construction time, which fails under pytest's captured
stdio unless a stub input/output is supplied).

Command palette (Step 11 follow-up, post-Build-Order): a real
`PromptSession` is now constructed with `completer=OhMyShellCompleter()`
and `complete_while_typing=True`, so typing "/" shows the slash-command
list (ui/palette.py) live, matching the person's explicit ask ("when press
/ then automatically show all the commands ... like claude code or hermes
agent"). This only affects the real, lazily-constructed `PromptSession` --
a test-injected `reader` never sees a completer at all, since fakes used
in tests don't implement prompt_toolkit's completion protocol and have no
reason to.

        Read one line.

        `formatted_text` is either a plain `str` (an ordinary sub-prompt
        like "Edit which param?") or a `str` already containing raw ANSI
        escape codes (ui/prompt.py's `render_prompt_ansi` output, used for
        the REPL's own colored main prompt). A raw-ANSI string is wrapped
        in prompt_toolkit's own `ANSI(...)` here before being handed to the
        underlying reader -- prompt_toolkit does not parse escape codes out
        of a bare `str` (it would render the literal escape bytes), and
        `ANSI(...)` is what actually turns them into styled terminal
        output while keeping prompt_toolkit's line-editing correct. Callers
        (main.py) don't need to know this distinction -- passing either
        kind of string here just works.

        Raises EOFError/KeyboardInterrupt exactly as `input()` would
        (prompt_toolkit's own contract), so main.py's existing
